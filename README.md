AndroidRadTools
===============
The whole purpose I started this project was so I could have everyone put more code generation into it.    It was originally on the Google Open Source Tree, now I moved it over to here.     It has been republished about 100 under different GitHubs and it has had slight tweaks to alter the features about 50 times.   The code has been migrated to Android Studio in another project.   Why don't people use GitHub/Google Source as it is intended.   Instead of trying to get credit for something a person didn't do, so they look good to potential employers we could possibly push things forward.    If we got rid of the mundane in coding rather than trying to take credit.   

The code was open source in 2010.   It had 50 replicate plugins with people saying the wrote it on their blogs without evening changing code.    This community is pitiful. 

Haven't published the 400 other changes I have made for the library because everyone wants to take credit rather than contribute and grow an open source project.    

Recruiters end up hiring people that have no idea what they are doing because people have a GitHub with a bunch of code exactly the same as other repoisitories.    

In the interview they'll talk about how they built this control and it is well recieved and that it's on their GitHub. 

Sad road social development is on.   

Social development has turned into let's see if I can skip the education, post a bunch of stuff, get overpaid for 12 months until the company realizes I haven't the slightest clue what I'm doing.....


Right click an android XML layout, go to Fast Layout, Generate Activity. It'll generate those tedious findViewById declarations.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t0c-x7HFJw
